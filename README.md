# bme680-env-monitor

This is a test endpoint that implements the [wire protocol](https://github.com/jonlamb-gh/air-gradient-pro-rs/blob/master/libraries/wire-protocols/src/broadcast.rs)
from my [air-gradient-pro](https://github.com/jonlamb-gh/air-gradient-pro-rs) project
to use as a reference for temp/humidity offset calibration.
